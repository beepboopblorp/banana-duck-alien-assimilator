# Banana Duck Alien Assimilator

We created this project for Hack Club's Days of Service Ascend Summit in LA! Our prompt was what technical tool would you want to bring with you into space? 
We choose to make a VR headset for astronauts to practice speaking with a special species of aliens called banana ducks! They must say the correct number of quacks, 
or else the banana ducks will get aggressive and begin to fight. Then, the player has to defeat them, or they will lose. Ishika designed the VR Headset/Astronaut Helmet using Onshape.
